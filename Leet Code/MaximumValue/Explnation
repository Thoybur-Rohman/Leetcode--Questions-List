Inuition
Given an array strs of alphanumeric strings, return the maximum value of any string in strs.
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters and digits

Approach
First initialize variables ( count , string stored in ch and maxTotal)
We then loop through each word eg [cat, dog1, hat66] our letter at ch[i] when I = 0 would be cat and so on etc.
Initialize boolean to see if we have found a letter
Loop through each individual letter in the word, e.g. ch[0][0] would be "cat" (using our previous example) and the second [0] would be c so e.g. ch[i][j]
We then have 2 if statements, 1 checks if it's a letter and the next if its a digit.

LETTER CHECKS
First, if j is between a and z
If it's a letter change letterFound to true
Add to count

DIGIT CHECKS
Checks if the number is between 0 and 9 adds to count
Finally, we have an if statement checks if letterFound = true meaning the word contains a letter if so we do maxTotal = the biggest number between the current max vs. the counted
Else we do the maximum between the current max and the string int value at point ch[i] NOT ch[i][j]
Count is reset
maxTotal is returned
