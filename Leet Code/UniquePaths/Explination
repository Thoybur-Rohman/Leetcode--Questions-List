- Intuition

The grid is m x n, meaning that it is a two-dimensional array
Robots start at grid[0][0] before moving forward.
A robot's destination will always be grid[m - 1][n - 1]) which is the bottom right corner
Whenever a robot moves, it can only go down or right.
The number of unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner should be computed.

- Approach

Make use of an array
Find all paths in the array by iterating through it
The first row and column will be 1s, and the surrounding rows and columns will be added
returns the sum of [m - 1][n - 1] in the grid.
