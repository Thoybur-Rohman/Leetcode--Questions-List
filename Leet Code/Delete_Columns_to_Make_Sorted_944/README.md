The function starts by declaring three local integer variables: "firstWordLength," "lengthOfArray," and "columnsDeleted." The value of "firstWordLength" is set to the length of the first string in the input array, "strs." The value of "lengthOfArray" is set to the length of the array "strs" minus 1. The value of "columnsDeleted" is set to 0.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the first string of the input array (which is stored at index 0). For each iteration of the loop, another loop is entered that iterates over the strings in the input array, starting at index 0 and ending at the second-to-last index.

Inside the inner loop, the function compares the character at the current index (which is stored in the variable "i") of the current string (which is stored in the variable "j") to the character at the same index of the next string (which is stored at index "j+1"). If the character in the current string is greater (i.e., has a higher ASCII value), the function increments the value of "columnsDeleted" by 1 and exits the inner loop using the "break" statement.

After both loops have completed, the function returns the value of "columnsDeleted.
