<Dictionary<int, string> nameAndHeights = new(); : Declares a new instance of a Dictionary, which is a collection that stores data in key-value pairs, with the key being an integer and the value being a string, and assigns it to the variable nameAndHeights.

for (int i=0; i<heights.Length; i++): This declares a for loop that will iterate for as many times as there are elements in the "heights" array. The loop variable is "i", which starts at 0 and is incremented with each iteration.

nameAndHeights.Add(heights[i], names[i]);: In each iteration of the loop, it adds the value of heights[i] as key and names[i] as value to nameAndHeights dictionary.

return nameAndHeights.OrderByDescending(x=>x.Key).Select(x=>x.Value).ToArray(); This returns an array containing the values in the nameAndHeights dictionary, sorted in descending order by the key (which is the height). The OrderByDescending method sorts the dictionary by key in descending order, the Select method selects the values from the dictionary, and the ToArray method converts the result to an array of strings.
