Type of question : loop


step 1 - convert the value of x to string by using String.valueOf(x);
step 2 - set int end = str.length() -1; as we only want the eliments of the inside loop as it will styart from 0 
step 3 - put a while loop to check start is smaller than end 
step 4 - we check the char at start and the char at end , if thet are trhe same we iterate up start and down end the number else return false 
step 5 - if everything is the same we return true
