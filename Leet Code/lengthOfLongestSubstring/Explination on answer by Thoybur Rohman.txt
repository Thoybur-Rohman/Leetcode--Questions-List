1) first we make a hahsmap which will store the letter and the int value 
2) we then set i = 0 as we want i to be the letter we compare to 
3 ) using j loop we check each letter in the string 
4 ) using map.containsKey(s.charAt(j))) - we use this to check if the current string at j 
has already been added to our hash map 
4.1- if it has then i will become the position of the letter we found using Math.Max which takes the highets 
value from the 2 inputs i = Math.max(map.get(s.charAt(j)), i); eg 

if p was in our hashmap and the and the value was 2 and our current value of i is 0 i will become 2 

5) if it is not in our hahsmap we will add it to our length again using math.max j - i + 1 ( we hadd + 1 becaue even if o
our length is 0 it still has a length of 1 as in oding 1 means 0 in length wise . 
6 ) abd theb we put the letter in the hahs map j + 1 again so we know the position  instead of using 
binary .
